======================

Sample code for potential employers.

Native IOS client for the java-spring-rest-server service.

Make sure you launch the java-spring-rest-server service by following the instructions in the java-spring-rest read me.

Once the java-spring-rest-server is launched open this project with XCode and launch it on your emulator, the url is coded to access localhost so if you want to run this on your device then make sure you change the ip address in the MasterViewController.m file.
